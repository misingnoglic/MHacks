Printerest is a program that allows Pinterest users to have postcards of their pins mailed to them, in order to create their own real life pinboards. The interface is via Python command line, and it makes use of the Pinterest and Lob APIs (as well as many other libraries).

The biggest challenge was getting the pictures to become a certain size without distorting the quality, but we finally got it to work, so yay!

Future additions may include a payment system, chrome extension and mobile app, as well as more customization options.

This was very hacked together (in 36 hours at MHacks), and was made before I had much formal CS knowledge (for example I use a giant list instead of a class to store a list of properties, the GUI is choppy, and it's all done with the command line) but I can't test it anymore, so I won't try to update it.

You can see a video of it running [here](http://printrest.net/demo.html).
